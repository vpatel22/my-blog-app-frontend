# The frontend for [my blog application](https://github.com/vpatel22/my-blog-app)

Additional details for this project can be found at the repo linked above. This repo is not deployed anywhere - rather, the FE changes for the blog application are made here and then (using `npm run build`) packaged up into a `build` folder for production use.

New ideas/issues are currently listed in a [Github Project](https://github.com/users/vpatel22/projects/2) and will be worked on eventually!

## Background context

This project is heavily based off of the [React: Creating and Hosting a Full-Stack Site](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/react-creating-and-hosting-a-full-stack-site-15153869?contextUrn=urn%3Ali%3AlyndaLearningPath%3A593715e0498e9e9be7fb8506&u=103733490) LinkedIn Learning course by Shaun Wassell. Feel free to take a look at the [Github Repo](https://github.com/LinkedInLearning/react-creating-and-hosting-a-full-stack-site-3209140) for that project as well.

This project started with the base [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) application and was heavily modified from that point.
